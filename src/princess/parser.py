"""
This pipeline extracts player choices and surrounding dialogue from the branching game scripts.

It consists of several stages:
1. Clean: preprocess the script to only keep the lines we are interested in.
2. Parse: use a minimal Lark grammar to parse the script into a tree structure (bottom-up).
3. Extract: traverse the tree top-down to extract the player choices and surrounding dialogue.
